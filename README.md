# COMPASS

COMPASS is a compact tokamak fusion energy device in Czech Republic.  
This simply bokeh application allows to study cross sections of plasma electron temperature Te and electron density Ne. Input data are stored in data directory.  

With this tool one can generate 2D data formatted for further spectroscopic analysis.
